I built a React and Redux-based E-Commerce web app that includes pages like Home, Shop, Cart, About, Features, and Contact. Products are fetched from an API, and the Shop page supports pagination for browsing. The cart is fully managed with Redux Toolkit, allowing add, remove, quantity update, and dynamic total calculation, while the cart count updates live in the navbar. This project helped me strengthen my skills.
